# HCM Economic Passage

This is not a transaction.

This is a **gesture**.

No product is delivered.
No service is guaranteed.
No acknowledgment is required.

---

Giving here changes nothing.
Withholding changes nothing.

---

This passage exists to allow support
without turning meaning into commodity.
